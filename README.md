**Narratium** is an AI-powered immersive interactive storytelling and creation platform, aiming to be an open-source alternative to AI Dungeon and a more user-friendly version of SillyTavern. Whether exploring fantasy worlds, seeking emotional resonance, or rewriting history, anyone can become the protagonist of their own epic.

## üåü Product Overview

Narratium aims to deliver a lightweight storytelling engine combining context compression, memory systems, and graph-based knowledge retrieval (Graph-RAG) to ensure character consistency and world coherence in long-form stories, significantly enhancing the immersion and continuity of AI-generated narratives.

The current version is available as a web-based interactive storytelling platform:

## üß© Why Narratium?

In the world of AI-powered interactive storytelling, common pain points include:

### SillyTavern

Powerful but overwhelming for beginners. Its complex setups, difficult card formats, and chaotic ecosystem can discourage new players before the adventure begins.

### AI Dungeon

Once a pioneer of infinite storytelling, it now erects walled gardens. Limited contexts, closed models, and lack of world customization restrict true ownership of adventures.

### Narratium changes everything.

We aim to make storytelling both simple and powerful:

* **Beginner-friendly**: Ready to play, intuitive interface, clear adventure, characters, and memory tracking.
* **Open & Extensible**: Open-source with support for any LLM, expandable characters, worlds, and memories.
* **Immersive & Consistent**: Focused on coherent storytelling, world logic, and character consistency, making every adventure a warm, personal, and traceable epic.
